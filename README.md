### Description

##### NO EDITS

This site (and especially its title) was inspired by the fact that most images of women in the media are heavily edited, filtered, posed, and created for the male gaze. This is true about the general media but even more true about women in action sports. Google "girl snowboarding" and you're far more likely to see an image of a girl in a bikini than one of a girl hucking a flip off a park jump. But in real life, a lot of girls ride park, and very few actually pose for sexy pictures at home with their snowboard. This website is intended to provide media content featuring women portrayed in action, directed toward women who are passionate about solo adventure and adrenaline sports, including, but not limited to: skiing, snowboarding, surfing, climbing, skating, mountain biking, skydiving, SCUBA diving... there is no limit.

##### User Stories

* **Account:** user can register, log in, log out, create a user profile, and post to models: gear reviews, quotes, and photo gallery. User can thus contribute to the general community and provide personal photos and insights to the community.

* **Gallery:** User can post images to the site's gallery, title and caption them, and search for images by keyword.

* **Quotes:** User can post motivational quotes related to outdoors, sports, women, or really anything at all. Meant to be a platform for motivation, not "venting" aka no angry "trigger" quotes. In this way, the general vibe of the site can evolve to reflect the evolution of users' values.

* **Forum:** Users can post questions, comments, or start a discussion about anything they choose, and interact with each other via this platform. This is potentially a space for venting/discussion. No filter.

* **Gear Reviews:** Users can post reviews of gear they like/dislike, and in this way, they can help other members of the community find and support gear that works for women (not necessarily just gear that is marketed toward women). *For example: I ride a men's snowboard. I could post a review of my board, and explain why I love it. This could lead to a discussion...*

* **News Content (Ongoing Goal):** If I were to develop this into a live site, I would include admin news articles of two categories: Adventure and Culture. Articles categorized as "adventure" would feature news regarding any developments of a particular sport, athlete, or destination. Articles categorized "culture" would feature news regarding gear/tech developments, lifestyle, advice, opinion, or motivation.
